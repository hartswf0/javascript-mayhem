# Bad Design Principles: Heuristics for Intentionally Unconventional UIs

## 1. Embrace Glitches and Errors
Incorporate visual glitches and errors as deliberate design elements.

Example: A text editor that randomly distorts characters as they're typed.

## 2. Subvert User Expectations
Design interfaces that deliberately contradict established patterns.

Example: A "submit" button that moves away from the cursor when approached.

## 3. Exaggerate Inefficiency
Create intentionally inefficient or convoluted processes.

Example: A multi-step process with unnecessary confirmations to perform a simple action like closing a window.

## 4. Prioritize Form Over Function
Design visually striking interfaces that challenge usability norms.

Example: A calendar app where dates are arranged in a spiral pattern rather than a grid.

## 5. Introduce Randomized Behavior
Implement controlled, randomized "malfunctions" that create unique experiences.

Example: A music player that occasionally plays songs at different speeds or in reverse.

## 6. Expose System Limitations
Deliberately showcase the limitations of digital systems.

Example: A word processor that visibly struggles and slows down when documents exceed a certain length.

## 7. Invert Control Schemes
Reverse or alter expected control mechanisms.

Example: A game where pressing 'up' moves the character down, and vice versa.

## 8. Emphasize Negative Emotions
Craft UIs that evoke frustration or confusion to challenge the notion that interfaces should always aim for positive emotional responses.

Example: A social media app that intentionally delays notifications to induce anxiety.

## 9. Break Consistency
Deliberately violate consistency in design to keep users engaged and alert.

Example: A website where the navigation menu is in a different location on each page.

## 10. Overload Sensory Input
Create interfaces that overwhelm users with excessive information or stimuli.

Example: A dashboard that displays all available data simultaneously, with constantly updating values and animations.

Note: These principles are intended for exploring critical and subversive approaches to interface design in an educational context. They should be applied thoughtfully and ethically, considering potential impacts on accessibility and user experience.
